What is Zettelkasten?**\nZettelkasten is a method of organizing notes and ideas into an interconnected network of related concepts. It was developed by German historian and sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 1950s and is based on the idea of creating a personal knowledge base by connecting individual notes together. The notes can be written using paper cards, digital notes, or other media, and can be connected through keywords, tags, or other relationships.\n\n**Q. What is Second Brain by Tiago Forte?**\nSecond Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity system that helps organize your ideas, projects, and notes into a unified knowledge base. It uses the Building A Second Brain (BASB) methodology to help you capture, organize, and share your ideas more effectively. It also includes tools for tracking progress on projects and goals, as well as content curation.\n\n**Q. What is a Literature Note? What is a Permanent Note?**\nA Literature Note is a note that is made from a source of literature, such as a book, article, or poem. It is used to summarize and analyze the text. A Permanent Note is a note that is kept and stored in an organized way for later reference. It usually contains information that will be relevant for the long term, such as lessons learned or facts about the topic.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.093051445Z","tags":null},"/Documentation/Literature-Note-Template":{"title":"{{title}}","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.089051387Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Brand-Positioning":{"title":"Brand Positioning","content":"\n*Brand positioning is an **iterative** process, with **precision** at its core.* It is the opposite of targeting all audiences with all types of services, but to be the ONE at a very narrow niche. This often means best-of-class, specific and clearly labelled services, for a specific targeted customer base.\n\n\u003e [!example]\n**General**: A freelance graphic design studio doing logos, web design, illustrations for various clients, with some emphasis in financial clients.\n\u003e \n**Specific**: A design studio focused on brand identity for credit unions.\n\nThe process of tuning your brand positioning can be done by assessing:\n- Positioning statement\n- Brand DNA\n- Differentiators (functional, emotional)\n- Core values\n- Brand personality (tone of voice)\n- Mission statement\n- Customer research (demographic and psychographic profiles)\n- Competitive research (direct, indirect)\n- Follow-up checklist, iterate!\n\n##### Positioning Statement\n\nAs known as the value proposition. Note if your target audience is broad or specific, if the benefits are clear, if there's a meaningful \"why\" behind the value proposition. Then, pick the one word that encompasses the brand's identity.\n\n\u003e [!note]\n*To **target audience**,\nour product is the **category**\nthat provides **functional, symbolic, or experiential benefits**\nbecause **reasons and purpose**.\nIn ONE word, **company name** is **brand DNA**.*\n\n##### Differentiators\n\n*There are **functional** and **emotional** benefits a brand can provide to the customer.* A functional benefit can be cost, quality, effectiveness. While an emotional benefit can be belongingness, wonder and awe, pleasure. List 5â€“10 benefits your brand offers to your target audience, then select the top **three** that you believe differentiates from competitors.\n\n##### Core Values\n\nBased on the value proposition, extract three short phrases that can represent the brand's core values. These can be guidelines in providing service, or ideals your brand represent, but they should refer back to the purpose.\n\n##### Brand Personality\n\nKeep in mind that this is the brand's personality. Imagine if the brand was a person, how would they speak? It's often an extension of the founder, but not always. Some resources are available from the Brand Personality Quiz developed by FINIEN freely available [here](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f), or investigate [Tone of Voice for Brands](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Tone%20of%20Voice%20for%20Brands.md).\n\n##### Mission Statement and Goal Statement\n\nSometimes the mission and goal are two separate statements, but that is overkill and splits the focus of the brand. Think about the customer's needs and the brand's purpose, and fill out this template.\n\n\u003e [!note]\n*We are on a mission to **impact on the world**\nthrough **activities, technologies, know-how, etc.**\nin order to **connect with your why**.*\n\n##### Research Customers and Competitors\n\nFocus on your specific niche, picture or research three people you see your brand doing business with. Then evaluate competitors that target the same audience.\n\n**Demographic Profile:** Age, Gender, Location, Nationality, Martial Status, No. of Children, Home Ownership, Occupation, Industry, Income, Education, App Usage.\n**Psychographic Profile:** Values, Attitudes, Interests / Hobbies, Preferred Brands, Other.\n\n***Direct Competition**: Companies that market the same products to the same target audience.*\n***Indirect Competition**: Companies that market different products to the same target audience.*\n\n##### Follow-ups\n\n**Iterate! Go back and refine the positioning statement and brand DNA.**\n- Does anything need to change? Logo, Colour Schema, Landing Page?\n- Does your market material showcase the unique differentiators?\n- Where are the target audience? How can you engage them?\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Branding Strategy for Creatives](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3973-brand-positioning-strategy-for-creatives)\n- [Branding Strategy Template](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.089051387Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Brand-Strategy-for-Identity-Design":{"title":"Brand Strategy for Identity Design","content":"\nBrand strategy can take many forms, but strive for the same outcome. *Strategy in this context is a set of decisions put in place to reach the goal **before we design**.* Akin to mapping out the journey before taking on a trip. \n\n*At times, **creatives** jump directly into design, and often gets **lost or stuck** as a result.* Strategy can act as a guideline to facilitate the design process and give design a purpose.\n\nHere are some common goals for brand identity:\n- I'm attracting the wrong customers.\n- My identity lacks connection to my brand.\n- My brand looks outdate compare to my competitors.\n- I'm rebranding my company to a different audience.\n\nKevin Craft suggests a three workshop framework.\n1. Keywords workshop\n2. Target Persona Workshop\n3. Competitive Audit Workshop\n\n##### Keyword workshop\n\nList as many adjectives you can to describe the brand, remove duplicates, and keep up to five dimensions that are the most important. For inspiration on keywords, there's a list on the \"brand personality\" section available on [Branding Strategy Template](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f).\n\nAlternatively, here's a short list to get started with.\n\u003e Adventurous, Minimal, Modern, Creative, Virtuous, Approachable, Knowledgeable,\n\u003e Local, Current, Progressive, Elegant, Skillful, Alternative, Exclusive,\n\u003e Fun, Exciting, Tech Savvy, Corporate, Emotional, Sustainable, Classic.\n\n##### Target Persona Workshop\n\nThere are many persona reseach processes, some are more in-depth than others. A simple persona template is to narrow down the persona by location, profession, age + gender, and one additional unique trait. This simplified template captures the esscence of demographic and psychographic profiles.\n\n##### Competitve Audit Workshop\n\nIdentify three to four competitors, possibly in conjunction with [Brand Positioning](Literature%20Notes/Art%20and%20Design/Brand%20Design/Brand%20Positioning.md) analysis. Look into their website and social media for market materials, then analysis what is working and what can be improved. Do the competitor brands stand out? Are they legible on different mediums? This information helps us define pitfalls to avoid and working strategies to incorporate.\n\n##### Mood Board\n\nCollection of pictures or artwork together in one composition, Pinterest and Behance and great platforms to discover and build mood boards. Keep a gathering tool handy, whether it be browser extensions or mobile apps to send any inspirational media you encounter to this mood board. Photography, colour schema, logos, etc. are all fair game, but do remember to keep in line with the identified.\n\n##### Colours\n\nColour is important to the brand. Each colour has a different meaning and should be appropriate to the brand's values. [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a great tool for generating colour palettes and supports sourcing colours from images.\n\nPick out a primary colour scheme and a secondary colour scheme. *Consider **pantone** matches for the colours to ensure compatiability with printing.* This can be done in Illustrator in advanced colour edit options, look for \"Pantone - Solid Coated\". Remeber that each selected colour should have a purpose.\n\n##### Patterns\n\n*A custom **pattern** is a great way to incorporate more elements from a brand strategy in order to strength the brand.* Patterns can be created from shapes on the logo, illustraions, or typography. Use the pattern screen function in illustrator (by double clicking a pattern in swatches) to help with the editing process.\n\n##### Typography\n\nCreate type hierarchy: headline, sub-head, body text, quotes. Leave some contrast between the logo and type, shouldn't be the exact same fonts, but rather communicates a similar feeling. Show examples with both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n##### Mockups\n\nOnly download and use mockups that fits some use case of the brand. Free options are available on Mr. Mockup and Create Market, whereas paid options are available on Envato Elements. It is always good to choose a mockup with shadows, since it provides more depth in its presentation.\n\n---\n\nResources:\n- [Strategy-Based Brand Identity Design](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3410-strategy-based-brand-identity-design)\n- [Mr. Mockup](https://mrmockup.com/)\n- [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)\n- [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.089051387Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Principles-of-Good-Logo-Design":{"title":"Principles of Good Logo Design","content":"\nThese principles act as the foundation for designing successful, long-lasting logos.\n- Simple, easy to recognize and remeber, number of colours\n- Relevant, matches the context of the industry\n- Memorable, makes a statement, evokes elements of uniqueness\n- Legible, clear and easy to read\n- Versatile, works in large and small sizes, prints and web mediums\n\nPresent the logo mark, centered, horizontal.\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Logotype Design for Brand Identity](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1659-logotype-design-for-brand-identity)","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.089051387Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Typography/Basic-Typography-Design":{"title":"Basic Typography Design","content":"\nLogotype or wordmark is a brand symbol built using typography. Good logotype design communicates the intention of a brand at a glance.\n\n##### The Creative Process\n\nStart with a creative brief, brand statement, project goals, or some words that best describe your brand. Think about use cases, if the logotype will be used in packaging, signage, mugs, apparel, etc. These should advise what mockups to explore later.\n\nResearch brand competitors, tease out what works in the industry and what doesn't. Also provides a guideline to standout and avoid being too similar to other brands.\n\nBuild a logo mood board, a presentation of curated design examples, showcase a large spectrum of style, execution, look and feel from multiple industries. Pinterest and Behance and good tools to  build mood boards.\n\nStart sketching, often times the mistakes made during this step becomes a major idea in the final design, don't worry about being perfect and explore various ideas quickly. This is a divergent thinking step.\n\nAfter exploring many concepts, select a few that you'd want to develop further digitally. Refer back to the brand statement and ethos to help pick up the style that feels right. Once selected, scan or take a photo of these sketches for reference in Illustrator.\n\n##### Picking a Base Font\n\nLuckily, there is no need to start from scratch to build out a font from sketches. There are some major categories of fonts that can be used as base fonts, typically san serif fonts are easier to manipulate due to their often uniform thickness.\n\n- ***Serif fonts** make a brand look classical, established, and trustworthy.* Some example serif fonts are Cardo. Prata, Chaparral, Baskerville, Mrs. Eaves, Easmes Century.\n- ***Sans serif fonts** are clean, modern, and engaging; they are also accessible due to being easy to read.* Some example san serif fonts are Century Gothic, Brooklyn, Sofia Pro, P22 Underground, Sweet Sans, Epilogue, Helvetica, Circular TT, GT Walsheim, Knockout.\n- ***Script fonts** are used to how the brand's more human and creative side.* Good script fonts are hard to find, some examples are Marvelous, Palm Caryor, Alondra, Avida La Bila.\n- Display fonts are eye-catching and unique. Examples are Swifted, Elody, Kinder, Oakland, New York, Passion Sans, Marigold.\n\nPick the correct base font to match industry, here are a few example combinations.\n- Modern: pick modern, simple, sans serif fonts.\n- Western: pick expressive, ornate, serif fonts.\n- Sports: pick modern fonts, use italics to look energetic, and bold to look strong.\n- Tech: pick clean, bold, simple, san serif fonts.\n- Law: pick trustworthy, established, and prestigious, serif fonts.\n\nYou would type out the brand name, and outline all points of the base font so that each element can be tweaked individually.\n\n##### Tweaking the Letterforms\n\nSome letters are easier to work with, some are harder due to the nature of their letterform.\nEasier letters to manipulate: A, E, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, P, W.\n\nAlso look for alternative forms of the letters, different weights, contrasting weights.\n\nTips for Illustrator\n- Bring out frequently used tools out on their own palette for ease of access.\n- Use a base font, then type out the logo and vectorize (Shift + Cmd + O on macOS), ungroup.\n\nThen pick a secondary font, there are two guidelines.\n1. They must have contrast, i.e. light vs. heavy or hard vs. sharp.\n2. They must go together and something in common, e.g., proportion, detail, vertical stress.\n\n##### Review / Present the Logotype\n\nFinally, print out your design in different sizes for review. Double check baseline, kerning, negative spaces, crossbars, etc. \n\nInclude mockups with the logotype presentation, such as mugs, bags, t-shirts, and signage. Some places to create mockups are Creative Market, Mr. Mockup, Layer, or DIY.\n\nShow examples of clear space, and misuse. Colour palette, primary and secondary colours.\n\nUltimately, these all cultivate into a brand guideline, possibly in conjunction with [Brand Positioning](Literature%20Notes/Art%20and%20Design/Brand%20Design/Brand%20Positioning.md) and [Tone of Voice for Brands](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Tone%20of%20Voice%20for%20Brands.md).\n\n##### Useful Definitions\n\n* Kerning is the space between letters in the type.\n* Ascender is the upstroke above the X-height.\n* Baseline is the line in which all letters \"sit\".\n* Descender is the part of the stroke that sits below the baseline.\n* Letterforms are the elements that form each character, e.g., apex, cap height, beak, stress, etc.\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Logo Modernism](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26786839)\n- [Logotype Design for Brand Identity](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1659-logotype-design-for-brand-identity)\n- [Strategy-Based Brand Identity Design](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3410-strategy-based-brand-identity-design)\n- [Typography Design for Brand Storytelling](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/4489-typography-design-for-brand-storytelling)\n- [Mr. Mockup](https://mrmockup.com/)\n- [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)\n- [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.093051445Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Creating-a-Tone-of-Voice-Guide":{"title":"Creating a Tone of Voice Guide","content":"\nA tone of voice guide outlines the elements involved with how to write like the brand. These elements include:\n\n- Brand Value\n- Audience\n- Tools\n- Writing\n- Examples\n- Modulate\n- Poster (Act as a visible prompt/reminder)\n\n*Aim for **3-5** brand values, it becomes difficult to write copy that has to be so many things simultaneously.* Brand often take on the personality of their founders, at lease initially. One can also think perspective. E.g. Nike is always positive.\n\nSome examples for brand values can be:\n- Considered: We weigh every word. Every one we add is a considered, defendable choice that earns its place.\n- Harmonious: Everything just works in unison - creating an overall harmony that captivates the reader\n\n*Brand values should be **specific and explained**. A brand value like \"funny\" can be interpreted in different ways and need to be further established with examples.* A list of brand values should be included with brief explanations, followed by full explanations on individual pages.\n\nAudience can be assessed with demographic and psychographic profiles. Get a sense of their age, role, location, pain points, and what their day looks like.\n\nBrand values can be used on their own, or packaged in tools like brand identity/philosophy, or a brand persona (this includes internal persona and external persona).\n\nFor instance, start with \"We write with a brand philosophy\", and then point out questions a writer can ask in order to sanity check if their copy sounds like what the brand would say.\n\n*Brand values can be further elaborated using specific explained examples, following a **like-this, not-like-this, because** formula.*\n- Like this: ...\n- Not like this: ...\n- Because: ...\n\nHaving the \"because\" section is important to help reduce the guesswork involved.\n\nA technically intensive tool would be the Iambic pentameter - a traditional poetry metric line and Shakespeare's favourite meter. It is defined as five sets of two-syllables alternating between unstressed and stressed syllables.\n\nThere are some debate around if a brand should have a different tone of voice for different social platforms. The perspective taken here is subtle: using the same tone of voice, but modulating it by the context of the subject.\n\n*Think of modulating as **fine-tuning** the dials of your brand values in the copy.* Let's investigate an example of a bank communicating to a customer about a missed payment, where the bank incorporates the brand values of \"open\", \"honest\", and \"daring\".\n\n\u003e *This is an **overly daring** example: \"Yo, you missed your payment, yeah? Get in touch with us and we'll get is sorted. Sweet.\"*\n\n\u003e *This is a **dishonest** example: \"We think you might have missed your payment, so you might want to give us a call. And hey, it's not going to be a problem. We can sort it out and everything will be amazing\".* \n\nWhy is this dishonest? The message isn't very clear, there's no ambiguity about the missing payments, and it is unlikely that the experience will be amazing. A better tuned example would be the following.\n\n\u003e Hi. Really sorry to let you know, but it seems like you've missed one of your payments. But don't worry, get in touch with us, and we'll help you resolve it, no problem. Thanks.\n\nThe openness of the message is dialed just correctly; it is honest and also daring in saying \"we'll help you resolve it, no problem.\" \n\nInclude a section in your tone of voice guide addressing modulation with examples. Start with \"We always sound like us\", and elaborate. For example: We speak with the same voice in everything we write. But, we'll occasionally talk in a different accent by modulating different elements of our brand value.\n\nFinally, summarizing key elements of the guide into a poster can act as a visual reminder of the brand's tone of voice. This can be placed on office walls or as the background of your browser new-tab page. The poster should have 4â€“5 highlights, and have brand values clearly identified.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.093051445Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Tone-of-Voice-for-Brands":{"title":"Tone of Voice for Brands","content":"\nEverybody talks differently, as an artifact from their upbringing, culture, experiences, and media consumed.  *A good exercise is to imagine brands as **people**, how would they speak?*\n\nLanguage is culture, a lot of companies focus on their external tone of voice but overlook their internal tone of voice in everyday communications (i.e. emails, meeting notes, etc.).\n\nImagine your brand wants to say that something is good, can you say:\n- It is good.\n- It is sick!\n- It is stupendous. (more complex, higher class)\n- It is great! (staying on the safe side).\n- It is amazing! (bit of an energetic word).\n- It is awesome! (targeted as a specific age group).\n- It is dope! (targeted as a specific age group).\n\nDifferent writers would bring their own personal experiences to a copy even if they were following a tone of voice guide, this is a good thing. The idea is to establish a guide, but not a set of rules.\n\n*Tone of voice helps people form a **relationship** with your brand.* It is difficult to imagine forming a relationship with someone that constant changes how they talk to you (e.g., a friend who completely changes their way they speak every few days); that relationship would be difficult, much like it would be for brands.\n\nNow, some examples of tone of voice:\n\n\u003e The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form of organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation. - H.P. Lovecraft, \"At the Mountains of Madness\"\n\nLovecraft fans love this sentence, it is in the region of 35-words, very few stops, and contains some difficult words. It is definitely fitting only for some specific audience.\n\n\u003e Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold. - John Steinbeck, \"The Grapes of Wrath\"\n\nSteinbeck's sentence is just as long, but contains much simpler words with some repetitions. This tone of voice is more application towards a wider audience.\n\n\u003e This oatmilk ad came to Log Angeles looking to make it as a giant billboard on sunset. Oh well. - Oatly, Bench Ad\n\n\u003e We've made a new drink. It's blue. It's tasty. It's blue. It's good for you. It's blue. It's made from apple, line, guava, and coconut water. It's blue. It's boosted with vitamins. It's blue. It's the perfect subject for a Venn diagram. Did we mention it's blue? - Innocent Drinks, Facebook Advert\n\nThese are very conversational and playful, note the use of short sentences and the speech pattern that mirrors young children. Other examples incorporate using number directly instead of text (i.e., \"2 of 5 benefits\" vs. \"two out of five dentists\", starting sentences with numbers). This is intended as a very natural tone of voice.\n\n\u003e I'm so mad at you, I can't believe you did that is amazing. - Tiffany \u0026 Co., Print Advert\n\nThe undertone is that between \"did/that\" the other person in the conversation pulled out a piece of Tiffany jewellery. This is a sentence structure that deliberately pivoted its focus mid-sentence. The idea is to express that life and change in an instant. The same pattern is also used in some insurance company copy, followed by the reassurance that you are covered regardless of the changes in life. Note the use of punctuation and lack of usage.\n\n*Remember that communication is **relative**, a single brand or person would talk **differently** under different context when talking to different people (or other brands).* Reflecting on how your personally change the way you talk in different situations will help with understanding tone of voice.\n\n---\n\nRelated: \n- [Creating a Tone of Voice Guide](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Creating%20a%20Tone%20of%20Voice%20Guide.md)\n\nResources:\n- [Tone of Voice in Copywriting for Brands](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3681-tone-of-voice-in-copywriting-for-brands)","lastmodified":"2023-01-31T03:35:19.093051445Z","tags":null},"/README":{"title":"","content":"# Project PolyBOK\n\nProject PolyBOK (i.e. Polymathic Body of Knowledge) is a [Polymathic Institute](http://polymathic.institute/) initiative to map out interconnected academic concepts that are created with learning in mind.

What is Zettelkasten?**\nZettelkasten is a method of organizing notes and ideas into an interconnected network of related concepts. It was developed by German historian and sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 1950s and is based on the idea of creating a personal knowledge base by connecting individual notes together. The notes can be written using paper cards, digital notes, or other media, and can be connected through keywords, tags, or other relationships.\n\n**Q. What is Second Brain by Tiago Forte?**\nSecond Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity system that helps organize your ideas, projects, and notes into a unified knowledge base.
