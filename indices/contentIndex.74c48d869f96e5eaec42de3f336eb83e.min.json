{"/":{"title":"","content":"# Project PolyBOK\n\nProject PolyBOK (i.e. Polymathic Body of Knowledge) is a [Polymathic Institute](http://polymathic.institute/) initiative to map out interconnected academic concepts that are created with learning in mind. Think Zettelkasten/Second Brain meets Anki meets edX.\n\nThe learning application based on this library is still under development. To browse the content of this body of knowledge for now, visit the [PolyBOK](https://library.polymathic.institute/) website.\n\nIn order to facilitate reviewing concepts via spaced repetition, every literature note should have its key ideas stylized specifically to enable prompt generation of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and binary questions. This is done in addition to the back-linking of related concepts in other literature notes.\n\n**The goals of enforcing this unique structure are to:**\n1. Allow discovery of related concepts so that a learner can learn a new concept that is relatable to their existing network of knowledge, which improves retention significantly.\n2. Allow mixing of keywords in neighbouring concepts such that the review prompt require the learner to differentiate between closely related concepts.\n3. Research has shown that by requiring generation within review prompts, we help to alleviate passive learning, increasing retention.\n\nIn the case that the body text provides poor structure or missing context to highlight as a review prompt, it is encouraged to provide a \"summary callout\" at the end of the note to include key ideas that have not been captured. \n\n**This repository is a ObsidianMD vault, and collaboration is welcome!**\n- **Important:** Ensure that links are made with \"Absolute Path in Vault\" and in Markdown style (i.e., Wikilinks disabled). See [quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/) for details.\n- Please see \"Documentation\" for literature note templates, prompt examples, etc.\n- Find the best-fit category/sub-category to place a literature note, but do connect with related literature note in any category.\n- Look into \"LanguageTool\" community plug-in for grammar and spelling.\n- Look into \"Text Generation\" community plug-in to help with writing (GPT-3).\n- All files under the folder \"Personal\" are git-ignored, you can use this area for permanent notes, article ideas, or GTD systems in here to take advantage of the shared literature notes.\n\t- The author personally uses this for blogs and brainstorming.\n- Just send me a pull-request when you have created some well-written notes, thanks!\n\n**TO-DOs**\n- [x] Create initial set of categories under Literature Notes\n- [ ] Create documentation on markup requirements for review prompts.\n- [ ] Create literature note template for quick start.\n- [x] Add some literature notes for reference.\n- [x] CI/CD to deploy PolyBOK on web.\n- [ ] Outline project roadmap.\n- [ ] Update Polymathic Institute website with landing page.\n\n---\n#### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n**Q. What is Zettelkasten?**\nZettelkasten is a method of organizing notes and ideas into an interconnected network of related concepts. It was developed by German historian and sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 1950s and is based on the idea of creating a personal knowledge base by connecting individual notes together. The notes can be written using paper cards, digital notes, or other media, and can be connected through keywords, tags, or other relationships.\n\n**Q. What is Second Brain by Tiago Forte?**\nSecond Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity system that helps organize your ideas, projects, and notes into a unified knowledge base. It uses the Building A Second Brain (BASB) methodology to help you capture, organize, and share your ideas more effectively. It also includes tools for tracking progress on projects and goals, as well as content curation.\n\n**Q. What is a Literature Note? What is a Permanent Note?**\nA Literature Note is a note that is made from a source of literature, such as a book, article, or poem. It is used to summarize and analyze the text. A Permanent Note is a note that is kept and stored in an organized way for later reference. It usually contains information that will be relevant for the long term, such as lessons learned or facts about the topic.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Documentation/Literature-Note-Template":{"title":"{{title}}","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.406391884Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Brand-Positioning":{"title":"Brand Positioning","content":"\n*Brand positioning is an **iterative** process, with **precision** at its core.* It is the opposite of targeting all audiences with all types of services, but to be the ONE at a very narrow niche. This often means best-of-class, specific and clearly labelled services, for a specific targeted customer base.\n\n\u003e [!example]\n**General**: A freelance graphic design studio doing logos, web design, illustrations for various clients, with some emphasis in financial clients.\n\u003e \n**Specific**: A design studio focused on brand identity for credit unions.\n\nThe process of tuning your brand positioning can be done by assessing:\n- Positioning statement\n- Brand DNA\n- Differentiators (functional, emotional)\n- Core values\n- Brand personality (tone of voice)\n- Mission statement\n- Customer research (demographic and psychographic profiles)\n- Competitive research (direct, indirect)\n- Follow-up checklist, iterate!\n\n## Positioning Statement\n\nAs known as the value proposition. Note if your target audience is broad or specific, if the benefits are clear, if there's a meaningful \"why\" behind the value proposition. Then, pick the one word that encompasses the brand's identity.\n\n\u003e [!note]\n*To **target audience**,\nour product is the **category**\nthat provides **functional, symbolic, or experiential benefits**\nbecause **reasons and purpose**.\nIn ONE word, **company name** is **brand DNA**.*\n\n## Differentiators\n\n*There are **functional** and **emotional** benefits a brand can provide to the customer.* A functional benefit can be cost, quality, effectiveness. While an emotional benefit can be belongingness, wonder and awe, pleasure. List 5–10 benefits your brand offers to your target audience, then select the top **three** that you believe differentiates from competitors.\n\n## Core Values\n\nBased on the value proposition, extract three short phrases that can represent the brand's core values. These can be guidelines in providing service, or ideals your brand represent, but they should refer back to the purpose.\n\n## Brand Personality\n\nKeep in mind that this is the brand's personality. Imagine if the brand was a person, how would they speak? It's often an extension of the founder, but not always. Some resources are available from the Brand Personality Quiz developed by FINIEN freely available [here](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f), or investigate [Tone of Voice for Brands](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Tone%20of%20Voice%20for%20Brands.md).\n\n## Mission Statement and Goal Statement\n\nSometimes the mission and goal are two separate statements, but that is overkill and splits the focus of the brand. Think about the customer's needs and the brand's purpose, and fill out this template.\n\n\u003e [!note]\n*We are on a mission to **impact on the world**\nthrough **activities, technologies, know-how, etc.**\nin order to **connect with your why**.*\n\n##### Research Customers and Competitors\n\nFocus on your specific niche, picture or research three people you see your brand doing business with. Then evaluate competitors that target the same audience.\n\n**Demographic Profile:** Age, Gender, Location, Nationality, Martial Status, No. of Children, Home Ownership, Occupation, Industry, Income, Education, App Usage.\n**Psychographic Profile:** Values, Attitudes, Interests / Hobbies, Preferred Brands, Other.\n\n***Direct Competition**: Companies that market the same products to the same target audience.*\n***Indirect Competition**: Companies that market different products to the same target audience.*\n\n## Follow-ups\n\n**Iterate! Go back and refine the positioning statement and brand DNA.**\n- Does anything need to change? Logo, Colour Schema, Landing Page?\n- Does your market material showcase the unique differentiators?\n- Where are the target audience? How can you engage them?\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Branding Strategy for Creatives](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3973-brand-positioning-strategy-for-creatives)\n- [Branding Strategy Template](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Brand-Strategy-for-Identity-Design":{"title":"Brand Strategy for Identity Design","content":"\nBrand strategy can take many forms, but strive for the same outcome. *Strategy in this context is a set of decisions put in place to reach the goal **before we design**.* Akin to mapping out the journey before taking on a trip. \n\n*At times, **creatives** jump directly into design, and often gets **lost or stuck** as a result.* Strategy can act as a guideline to facilitate the design process and give design a purpose.\n\nHere are some common goals for brand identity:\n- I'm attracting the wrong customers.\n- My identity lacks connection to my brand.\n- My brand looks outdate compare to my competitors.\n- I'm rebranding my company to a different audience.\n\nKevin Craft suggests a three workshop framework.\n1. Keywords workshop\n2. Target Persona Workshop\n3. Competitive Audit Workshop\n\n##### Keyword workshop\n\nList as many adjectives you can to describe the brand, remove duplicates, and keep up to five dimensions that are the most important. For inspiration on keywords, there's a list on the \"brand personality\" section available on [Branding Strategy Template](https://findcongwang.notion.site/Brand-Positioning-Strategy-Template-0a1113fd5b764c27818e38f5e5b5847f).\n\nAlternatively, here's a short list to get started with.\n\u003e Adventurous, Minimal, Modern, Creative, Virtuous, Approachable, Knowledgeable,\n\u003e Local, Current, Progressive, Elegant, Skillful, Alternative, Exclusive,\n\u003e Fun, Exciting, Tech Savvy, Corporate, Emotional, Sustainable, Classic.\n\n##### Target Persona Workshop\n\nThere are many persona reseach processes, some are more in-depth than others. A simple persona template is to narrow down the persona by location, profession, age + gender, and one additional unique trait. This simplified template captures the esscence of demographic and psychographic profiles.\n\n##### Competitve Audit Workshop\n\nIdentify three to four competitors, possibly in conjunction with [Brand Positioning](Literature%20Notes/Art%20and%20Design/Brand%20Design/Brand%20Positioning.md) analysis. Look into their website and social media for market materials, then analysis what is working and what can be improved. Do the competitor brands stand out? Are they legible on different mediums? This information helps us define pitfalls to avoid and working strategies to incorporate.\n\n##### Mood Board\n\nCollection of pictures or artwork together in one composition, Pinterest and Behance and great platforms to discover and build mood boards. Keep a gathering tool handy, whether it be browser extensions or mobile apps to send any inspirational media you encounter to this mood board. Photography, colour schema, logos, etc. are all fair game, but do remember to keep in line with the identified.\n\n##### Colours\n\nColour is important to the brand. Each colour has a different meaning and should be appropriate to the brand's values. [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a great tool for generating colour palettes and supports sourcing colours from images.\n\nPick out a primary colour scheme and a secondary colour scheme. *Consider **pantone** matches for the colours to ensure compatiability with printing.* This can be done in Illustrator in advanced colour edit options, look for \"Pantone - Solid Coated\". Remeber that each selected colour should have a purpose.\n\n##### Patterns\n\n*A custom **pattern** is a great way to incorporate more elements from a brand strategy in order to strength the brand.* Patterns can be created from shapes on the logo, illustraions, or typography. Use the pattern screen function in illustrator (by double clicking a pattern in swatches) to help with the editing process.\n\n##### Typography\n\nSelect a set of primary and secondary fonts for the brand, see [Basic Typography Design](Literature%20Notes/Art%20and%20Design/Typography/Basic%20Typography%20Design.md). Leave some contrast between the logo text and copy text, shouldn't be the exact same fonts, but rather communicates a similar feeling. \n* Remember to create type hierarchy, i.e. headline, sub-head, body text, quotes maybe use different fonts and weights. \n* Remember to demonstrate examples with both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n##### Mockups\n\nOnly download and use mockups that fits some use case of the brand. Free options are available on Mr. Mockup and Create Market, whereas paid options are available on Envato Elements. It is always good to choose a mockup with shadows, since it provides more depth in its presentation.\n\n---\n\nResources:\n- [Strategy-Based Brand Identity Design](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3410-strategy-based-brand-identity-design)\n- [Mr. Mockup](https://mrmockup.com/)\n- [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)\n- [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Brand-Design/Principles-of-Good-Logo-Design":{"title":"Principles of Good Logo Design","content":"\nThese principles act as the foundation for designing successful, long-lasting logos.\n- Simple, easy to recognize and remeber, number of colours\n- Relevant, matches the context of the industry\n- Memorable, makes a statement, evokes elements of uniqueness\n- Legible, clear and easy to read\n- Versatile, works in large and small sizes, prints and web mediums\n\nPresent the logo mark, centered, horizontal.\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Logotype Design for Brand Identity](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1659-logotype-design-for-brand-identity)","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Art-and-Design/Typography/Basic-Typography-Design":{"title":"Basic Typography Design","content":"\nLogotype or wordmark is a brand symbol built using typography. Good logotype design communicates the intention of a brand at a glance.\n\n## The Creative Process\n\nStart with a creative brief, brand statement, project goals, or some words that best describe your brand. Think about use cases, if the logotype will be used in packaging, signage, mugs, apparel, etc. These should advise what mockups to explore later.\n\nResearch brand competitors, tease out what works in the industry and what doesn't. Also provides a guideline to standout and avoid being too similar to other brands.\n\nBuild a logo mood board, a presentation of curated design examples, showcase a large spectrum of style, execution, look and feel from multiple industries. Pinterest and Behance and good tools to  build mood boards.\n\nStart sketching, often times the mistakes made during this step becomes a major idea in the final design, don't worry about being perfect and explore various ideas quickly. This is a divergent thinking step.\n\nAfter exploring many concepts, select a few that you'd want to develop further digitally. Refer back to the brand statement and ethos to help pick up the style that feels right. Once selected, scan or take a photo of these sketches for reference in Illustrator.\n\n## Picking a Base Font\n\nLuckily, there is no need to start from scratch to build out a font from sketches. There are some major categories of fonts that can be used as base fonts, typically san serif fonts are easier to manipulate due to their often uniform thickness.\n\n- ***Serif fonts** make a brand look classical, established, and trustworthy.* Some example serif fonts are Cardo. Prata, Chaparral, Baskerville, Mrs. Eaves, Easmes Century.\n- ***Sans serif fonts** are clean, modern, and engaging; they are also accessible due to being easy to read.* Some example san serif fonts are Century Gothic, Brooklyn, Sofia Pro, P22 Underground, Sweet Sans, Epilogue, Helvetica, Circular TT, GT Walsheim, Knockout.\n- ***Script fonts** are used to how the brand's more human and creative side.* Good script fonts are hard to find, some examples are Marvelous, Palm Caryor, Alondra, Avida La Bila.\n- Display fonts are eye-catching and unique. Examples are Swifted, Elody, Kinder, Oakland, New York, Passion Sans, Marigold.\n\nPick the correct base font to match industry, here are a few example combinations.\n- Modern: pick modern, simple, sans serif fonts.\n- Western: pick expressive, ornate, serif fonts.\n- Sports: pick modern fonts, use italics to look energetic, and bold to look strong.\n- Tech: pick clean, bold, simple, san serif fonts.\n- Law: pick trustworthy, established, and prestigious, serif fonts.\n\nYou would type out the brand name, and outline all points of the base font so that each element can be tweaked individually.\n\n## Tweaking the Letterforms\n\nSome letters are easier to work with, some are harder due to the nature of their letterform.\nEasier letters to manipulate: A, E, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, P, W.\n\nAlso look for alternative forms of the letters, different weights, contrasting weights.\n\nTips for Illustrator\n- Bring out frequently used tools out on their own palette for ease of access.\n- Use a base font, then type out the logo and vectorize (Shift + Cmd + O on macOS), ungroup.\n\nThen pick a secondary font, there are two guidelines.\n1. They must have contrast, i.e. light vs. heavy or hard vs. sharp.\n2. They must go together and something in common, e.g., proportion, detail, vertical stress.\n\n## Review / Present the Logotype\n\nFinally, print out your design in different sizes for review. Double check baseline, kerning, negative spaces, crossbars, etc. \n\nInclude mockups with the logotype presentation, such as mugs, bags, t-shirts, and signage. Some places to create mockups are Creative Market, Mr. Mockup, Layer, or DIY.\n\nShow examples of clear space, and misuse. Colour palette, primary and secondary colours.\n\nUltimately, these all cultivate into a brand guideline, possibly in conjunction with [Brand Positioning](Literature%20Notes/Art%20and%20Design/Brand%20Design/Brand%20Positioning.md) and [Creating a Tone of Voice Guide](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Creating%20a%20Tone%20of%20Voice%20Guide.md).\n\n## Useful Definitions\n\n* Kerning is the space between letters in the type.\n* Ascender is the upstroke above the X-height.\n* Baseline is the line in which all letters \"sit\".\n* Descender is the part of the stroke that sits below the baseline.\n* Letterforms are the elements that form each character, e.g., apex, cap height, beak, stress, etc.\n\n---\n\nResources: \n- [Logo Modernism](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26786839)\n- [Logotype Design for Brand Identity](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1659-logotype-design-for-brand-identity)\n- [Strategy-Based Brand Identity Design](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3410-strategy-based-brand-identity-design)\n- [Typography Design for Brand Storytelling](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/4489-typography-design-for-brand-storytelling)\n- [Mr. Mockup](https://mrmockup.com/)\n- [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/)\n- [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Creating-a-Tone-of-Voice-Guide":{"title":"Creating a Tone of Voice Guide","content":"\nA tone of voice guide outlines the elements involved with how to write like the brand. These elements include:\n\n- Brand Value\n- Audience\n- Tools\n- Writing\n- Examples\n- Modulate\n- Poster (Act as a visible prompt/reminder)\n\n*Aim for **3-5** brand values, it becomes difficult to write copy that has to be so many things simultaneously.* Brand often take on the personality of their founders, at lease initially. One can also think perspective. E.g. Nike is always positive.\n\nSome examples for brand values can be:\n- Considered: We weigh every word. Every one we add is a considered, defendable choice that earns its place.\n- Harmonious: Everything just works in unison - creating an overall harmony that captivates the reader\n\n*Brand values should be **specific and explained**. A brand value like \"funny\" can be interpreted in different ways and need to be further established with examples.* A list of brand values should be included with brief explanations, followed by full explanations on individual pages.\n\nAudience can be assessed with demographic and psychographic profiles. Get a sense of their age, role, location, pain points, and what their day looks like.\n\nBrand values can be used on their own, or packaged in tools like brand identity/philosophy, or a brand persona (this includes internal persona and external persona).\n\nFor instance, start with \"We write with a brand philosophy\", and then point out questions a writer can ask in order to sanity check if their copy sounds like what the brand would say.\n\n*Brand values can be further elaborated using specific explained examples, following a **like-this, not-like-this, because** formula.*\n- Like this: ...\n- Not like this: ...\n- Because: ...\n\nHaving the \"because\" section is important to help reduce the guesswork involved.\n\nA technically intensive tool would be the Iambic pentameter - a traditional poetry metric line and Shakespeare's favourite meter. It is defined as five sets of two-syllables alternating between unstressed and stressed syllables.\n\nThere are some debate around if a brand should have a different tone of voice for different social platforms. The perspective taken here is subtle: using the same tone of voice, but modulating it by the context of the subject.\n\n*Think of modulating as **fine-tuning** the dials of your brand values in the copy.* Let's investigate an example of a bank communicating to a customer about a missed payment, where the bank incorporates the brand values of \"open\", \"honest\", and \"daring\".\n\n\u003e *This is an **overly daring** example: \"Yo, you missed your payment, yeah? Get in touch with us and we'll get is sorted. Sweet.\"*\n\n\u003e *This is a **dishonest** example: \"We think you might have missed your payment, so you might want to give us a call. And hey, it's not going to be a problem. We can sort it out and everything will be amazing\".* \n\nWhy is this dishonest? The message isn't very clear, there's no ambiguity about the missing payments, and it is unlikely that the experience will be amazing. A better tuned example would be the following.\n\n\u003e Hi. Really sorry to let you know, but it seems like you've missed one of your payments. But don't worry, get in touch with us, and we'll help you resolve it, no problem. Thanks.\n\nThe openness of the message is dialed just correctly; it is honest and also daring in saying \"we'll help you resolve it, no problem.\" \n\nInclude a section in your tone of voice guide addressing modulation with examples. Start with \"We always sound like us\", and elaborate. For example: We speak with the same voice in everything we write. But, we'll occasionally talk in a different accent by modulating different elements of our brand value.\n\nFinally, summarizing key elements of the guide into a poster can act as a visual reminder of the brand's tone of voice. This can be placed on office walls or as the background of your browser new-tab page. The poster should have 4–5 highlights, and have brand values clearly identified.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Tone-of-Voice-for-Brands":{"title":"Tone of Voice for Brands","content":"\nEverybody talks differently, as an artifact from their upbringing, culture, experiences, and media consumed.  *A good exercise is to imagine brands as **people**, how would they speak?*\n\nLanguage is culture, a lot of companies focus on their external tone of voice but overlook their internal tone of voice in everyday communications (i.e. emails, meeting notes, etc.).\n\nImagine your brand wants to say that something is good, can you say:\n- It is good.\n- It is sick!\n- It is stupendous. (more complex, higher class)\n- It is great! (staying on the safe side).\n- It is amazing! (bit of an energetic word).\n- It is awesome! (targeted as a specific age group).\n- It is dope! (targeted as a specific age group).\n\nDifferent writers would bring their own personal experiences to a copy even if they were following a tone of voice guide, this is a good thing. The idea is to establish a guide, but not a set of rules.\n\n*Tone of voice helps people form a **relationship** with your brand.* It is difficult to imagine forming a relationship with someone that constant changes how they talk to you (e.g., a friend who completely changes their way they speak every few days); that relationship would be difficult, much like it would be for brands.\n\nNow, some examples of tone of voice:\n\n\u003e The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form of organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation. - H.P. Lovecraft, \"At the Mountains of Madness\"\n\nLovecraft fans love this sentence, it is in the region of 35-words, very few stops, and contains some difficult words. It is definitely fitting only for some specific audience.\n\n\u003e Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold. - John Steinbeck, \"The Grapes of Wrath\"\n\nSteinbeck's sentence is just as long, but contains much simpler words with some repetitions. This tone of voice is more application towards a wider audience.\n\n\u003e This oatmilk ad came to Log Angeles looking to make it as a giant billboard on sunset. Oh well. - Oatly, Bench Ad\n\n\u003e We've made a new drink. It's blue. It's tasty. It's blue. It's good for you. It's blue. It's made from apple, line, guava, and coconut water. It's blue. It's boosted with vitamins. It's blue. It's the perfect subject for a Venn diagram. Did we mention it's blue? - Innocent Drinks, Facebook Advert\n\nThese are very conversational and playful, note the use of short sentences and the speech pattern that mirrors young children. Other examples incorporate using number directly instead of text (i.e., \"2 of 5 benefits\" vs. \"two out of five dentists\", starting sentences with numbers). This is intended as a very natural tone of voice.\n\n\u003e I'm so mad at you, I can't believe you did that is amazing. - Tiffany \u0026 Co., Print Advert\n\nThe undertone is that between \"did/that\" the other person in the conversation pulled out a piece of Tiffany jewellery. This is a sentence structure that deliberately pivoted its focus mid-sentence. The idea is to express that life and change in an instant. The same pattern is also used in some insurance company copy, followed by the reassurance that you are covered regardless of the changes in life. Note the use of punctuation and lack of usage.\n\n*Remember that communication is **relative**, a single brand or person would talk **differently** under different context when talking to different people (or other brands).* Reflecting on how your personally change the way you talk in different situations will help with understanding tone of voice.\n\n---\n\nRelated: \n- [Creating a Tone of Voice Guide](Literature%20Notes/Communication/Copyrighting/Creating%20a%20Tone%20of%20Voice%20Guide.md)\n\nResources:\n- [Tone of Voice in Copywriting for Brands](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3681-tone-of-voice-in-copywriting-for-brands)","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Sustainability/Future-Thinking/Example-Future-Drivers":{"title":"Example Future Drivers","content":"\nMoving from \"dumb\" clothes to \"smart\" clothes, and then from \"smart\" clothes to \"smarter-than-us\" clothes.\n\nIncreased intensity of storms, fires, and floods due to climate change.\n\nFalling fertility rates worldwide.\n\nEnd of cash and rise of digital currency.\n\nRise of Emojis and visual communication.\n\nUnderpopulation in Western and East Asian nations will create the possibility of steady-state economies that aim for stable population and consumption.\n\nA hegemonic shift from an American-centric world to an Asian-centric century.\n\nMajor disruptions in the global food industry from cellular agriculture, and the end of animal-based food supply chain.\n\nShift from coal and oil based energy generation to solar, wind, and other renewables.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Sustainability/Future-Thinking/Future-Artifact":{"title":"Future Artifact","content":"\nCreate a features list, start by gathering all the information about this future world.\n\n- Positive and negative aspect of the object.\n- Horizon, which technologies would be needed to make the artifact.\n- User profile, can be leveraged to design a particular user experience.\n- Location, in which the object can relate to in terms of culture and materials.\n- Journey, which describe the pain points and struggles that the characters experienced with the object.\n- The place, space and interactions that the object has with its environment and user.\n\n1.

Futures and Ambitions\n\nThe United Nations sustainable development department [link](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and World Economic Forum's [global risk assessment](https://www.weforum.org/global-risks) are great places to look for pressing problems for synthesizing futures.\n\nUnderstanding how things can shift: the impossible becomes the inevitable, or vice versa.\nWhen Future forecasting, think at least in 10-year timeframes. It is far enough out that things can be really different. This allows you to move past the constraints of today and have enough time to plan, gather resources, recruit allies, and take action.\n\nFutures Wheel\n\nThe future is never simple: most things that are good have a downside, and most things that are bad have some positive effects.\n\nBrainstorm in a structured way, positive consequences and negative consequences. Think from the perspective of different age groups, geographical locations; think about this in different lines of the social, technological, and economic repercussions.\n\nFirst order of consequence, these are very intuitive based on the future being researched; try to capture five to ten for the futures wheel.\n\nSecond order consequences are harder to determine even for seasoned futurists. It may be helpful to consider consequences along the STEEP framework.\n\n- Social: consumer behaviour, culture, demographics, religion, lifestyles, values, media, health.\n- Technological: innovation, communication, energy, transportation, biotech, digital.\n- Economic: employment, startups, bankruptcies, recession/expansion, interest rates, international trade, taxes.\n- Environmental: greenhouse has emissions, extinctions, climate change, deforestation, water, agriculture.\n- Political: elections, wars, regulations.\n\nE.g., if cars were the subject, the first order consequence may be the construction of roads, and the second order consequences would be traffic jams and licensing.\n\nThen introduce random factors and chaos to help think through additional second order consequences.\n\nE.g. portable computer → foldable computer → edible computer.\nE.g. driverless cars → farmerless farms.\n\nGather signals and drivers\n\nA signal of change is anything that is already happening today, that could be a clue to the future. This signal can be a new invention, product, business, behaviour, law, or even crime. Signals are examples of their underlying drivers.\n\nUse these signals to derive their underlying driver for change. Drivers are the big changes that already underway, and they move society towards particular futures, every signal has at least one driver behind it. [Example Future Drivers](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Example%20Future%20Drivers.md)\n\nAside: How to make a quick forecast.\n1. Pick a driver of change. E.g., self-driving cars.\n2. Pick a specific topic you are interested in. E.g., Real Estates, Legislation.\n3. Apply the driver on the topic. Think what will become more common and what will become less common due to this driver.\n\t- Innovators will come along and repurpose uses for residential driveway and garages that no longer need to contain personal vehicles.\n\t- Legislation adoption will be sporadic, some places will ban human-driving, some will allow mix-driving, and some will block the adoption of autonomous vehicles.\n\nFutures Cone (Voros Cone)\n\nCategorize into\n- Probable Future - Futures that likely to happen or is happening already.\n- Plausible Future - Futures that you think can happen based on the current understanding of the world.\n- Possible Future - Futures that we think might happen based on things we do not know yet and are not sure of, but might be one day.\n- Impossible Future - Futures that you think are ridiculous or can never happen.\n\nAlso look into the past for buildups and reactions, the trajectory of how the world got to today.\nThen also plot along a timeline, i.e., 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 100 years.\nAdd notes on different futures, either drivers, risks, or global trends, then use these to spot any dependencies exist between timeframes.\n\nThis allows us to formulate succinct forecast statements to capture the essence of a future scenario. For example, by the year 2030, theft of personal objects will be uncommon and almost impossible due to Internet of Things.\n\nA good short-term (i.e., 10 years) forecast is possible, provocative, and plausible. There are plenty of signals and drivers contributing to its direction; it makes people stop, think, and sparks conversation; and it is plausible albeit not inevitable, such that there are actions to take in order to be actualized or avoided.\n\nIt is important here to note the importance of a forecast to be provocative over being an accurate prediction, so that it engages conversations and actions.\n\nDefinition: VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.\n\nIn a VUCA world, volatility yield vision, uncertainty yields to understanding complexity yields to clarity and ambiguity yields to agility. Vision gets rewarded disproportionally as people seek answers, especially in volatile situations. Uncertainty breeds the effort to understand the surrounding environment. Complexity reduces the possibility of detailed plans into clear intents of direction. \n\nWith these research, we can explore [Future Scenario and World Building](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Scenario%20and%20World%20Building.md).\n\nResources:\n- [Designing Products of the Future](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1880-designing-products-of-the-future)\n- [Futures Thinking Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/futures-thinking)\n- [Envisioning.io](https://www.envisioning.io/)\n- [Futures Cone](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/vision-and-strategy-toolkit/futures-cone)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Sustainability/Future-Thinking/Future-Scenario-and-World-Building":{"title":"Future Scenario and World Building","content":"\nWith signals, drivers, consequences, and timelines mapped out, the next thing to do is to package these possible futures into scenarios or microfiction. The goal of creating scenarios is to ultimately provoke conversations on a possible future. Scenario allow exploration from various perspective, how are different groups affected and how would they react to these futures.\n\nWorld building is a technique that writers use to develop their story.\n\nPick a horizon to build world about\n- Entrepreneurs looking to build an actual product or service may gravitate towards near term horizons.\n- Sci-Fi writers may explore a much further horizon for world building.\n\nPick a point-of-view (POV). For beginners, it is recommended to pick yourself as your POV because you know yourself well and have the experiences to apply in world building.\n\nUsing a different perspective is possible with a lot of research, understanding the persona's pain points, values, etc.\n\nPick a location. Keep in mind that the further you move away from your own experiences, the more you'd need to research to understand the particular context and environment.\n\nWorld details\n\n1. Pick a specific place; e.g., a street corner, the kitchen, at the airport waiting area.\n2. Describe what the place look like; walls, ceiling, floors, etc.\n3. Describe what objects are in this space; cars, cup, furniture, etc.\n4. How do people/animals/bots interact with those objects?\n\nChallenge all of your assumptions, then iterate again. Review the futures, horizons, and world context, and question the details from the previous iteration. \n\nE.g., would there be streets at all in a world of flying cars?\nIf plants were intelligent, how would they move about?\n\nWrite a Microfiction - literally the shortest story you can imagine.\n1. Set up the scene, based on the POV chosen.\n2. Introduce a challenge, take inspiration from negative consequences.\n3. Despite their best efforts, the character challenges grow into problems.\n4. Faced with a crisis, the characters abandon old solutions to try something new.\n5. The new approach makes a little progress.\n6. The approach is refined, and the characters regained stability.\n7. Conclude on the story, either triumphant or loss.\n\nMagazines are a good medium for exploring alternative futures and storylines.\nNow take the [Future Artifact](Literature%20Notes/Sustainability/Future%20Thinking/Future%20Artifact.md) that the characters used in their story, and create it today.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Sustainability/Future-Thinking/Future-Simulation":{"title":"Future Simulation","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null},"/README":{"title":"","content":"# Project PolyBOK\n\nProject PolyBOK (i.e. Polymathic Body of Knowledge) is a [Polymathic Institute](http://polymathic.institute/) initiative to map out interconnected academic concepts that are created with learning in mind.

To browse the content of this body of knowledge for now, visit the [PolyBOK](https://library.polymathic.institute/) website.\n\nIn order to facilitate reviewing concepts via spaced repetition, every literature note should have its key ideas stylized specifically to enable prompt generation of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and binary questions. This is done in addition to the back-linking of related concepts in other literature notes.\n\n**The goals of enforcing this unique structure are to:**\n1. Allow discovery of related concepts so that a learner can learn a new concept that is relatable to their existing network of knowledge, which improves retention significantly.\n2. Allow mixing of keywords in neighbouring concepts such that the review prompt require the learner to differentiate between closely related concepts.\n3. Research has shown that by requiring generation within review prompts, we help to alleviate passive learning, increasing retention.\n\nIn the case that the body text provides poor structure or missing context to highlight as a review prompt, it is encouraged to provide a \"summary callout\" at the end of the note to include key ideas that have not been captured. \n\n**This repository is a ObsidianMD vault, and collaboration is welcome!**\n- **Important:** Ensure that links are made with \"Absolute Path in Vault\" and in Markdown style (i.e., Wikilinks disabled).

What is Zettelkasten?**\nZettelkasten is a method of organizing notes and ideas into an interconnected network of related concepts. It was developed by German historian and sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 1950s and is based on the idea of creating a personal knowledge base by connecting individual notes together. The notes can be written using paper cards, digital notes, or other media, and can be connected through keywords, tags, or other relationships.\n\n**Q. What is Second Brain by Tiago Forte?**\nSecond Brain by Tiago Forte is a productivity system that helps organize your ideas, projects, and notes into a unified knowledge base. It uses the Building A Second Brain (BASB) methodology to help you capture, organize, and share your ideas more effectively. It also includes tools for tracking progress on projects and goals, as well as content curation.\n\n**Q. What is a Literature Note? What is a Permanent Note?**\nA Literature Note is a note that is made from a source of literature, such as a book, article, or poem. It is used to summarize and analyze the text. A Permanent Note is a note that is kept and stored in an organized way for later reference. It usually contains information that will be relevant for the long term, such as lessons learned or facts about the topic.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-11T19:37:32.410391933Z","tags":null}}
